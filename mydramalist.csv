It was created by a man named Brusa Ee, who came to Japan and built the hidden village Juugenkyou. Juuken is a martial art in which one mimics the abilities of animals as well as trying to attain spiritual peace. However, dissent grew among the creator's ten students. Three of them believed that they should use the suffering and hatred harnessed within humans to increase their power, using their power to assume their monstrous forms; the Three Kenma. After Brusa Ee was murdered, the Kenma gathered followers to practice an evil form of the Juuken style known as Rin Juuken Akugata. The other seven students believed that true strength should come from within and engaged their former friends in a great war, ending the fight with a forbidden technique to seal the Kenma' powers at the cost of losing their own human forms in the process, becoming the Seven Kensei. Followers of the Kensei created the Geki Juuken Beast Arts school: the Juuken of justice whose sport discipline enhances the human body with the self-produced positive Qi called ""Geki"". It is taught by Grand Master Xia Fu, one of the Seven Kensei, using a sports goods company named ""SCRTC"" as a front. 

In the present time, a fallen student from the Geki Juuken school named Rio turns to the Rin Juuken style, rebuilding the Rinjuu Hall and brought the long-dead Rin Juuken users back to life as kyonshi to collect Rinki, Geki's polar opposite Qi, in order to resurrect the Three Kenma so that through them, he can become stronger. To fight the new Rinjuu Hall, Xia Fu had been training two youths: Ran Uzaki and Retu Fukami. Along with Jyan Kandou, a feral boy raised by tigers in the woods near Juugenkyou, the Gekiranger team is formed and later joined by two other Geki Juuken users, Gou Fukami, Retu's brother and master of the Geki Juu Wolf-Ken style, and Ken Hisatsu, a genius master of the Geki Juu Rhinoceros-Ken style, to save the world from the Akugata's ambitions. However, an even greater evil is using the two sides for its own agenda.
